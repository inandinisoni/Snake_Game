## Snake Game in Python with Turtle

This project implements a classic Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics library.

### Dependencies

This project requires the following Python library:

* turtle

You can install it using pip:

bash
pip install turtle


### Running the Game

1. Save the Python script (e.g., snake_game.py) in your desired directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the following command:

bash
python snake_game.py


### Gameplay

* Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the movement of the snake.
* The goal is to collect food (represented by a square) that appears randomly on the screen.
* Collecting food increases the snake's length and the score.
* Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body, which will result in game over.

### Project Structure

The project code might be organized into functions for:

* Setting up the game screen (title, background color, borders)
* Creating the snake head (shape, color, movement)
* Generating food (random position, shape, color)
* Detecting collisions (with walls, food, snake body)
* Updating the score
* Handling keyboard input for movement
* Controlling game loop and speed
